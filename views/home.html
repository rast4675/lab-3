            <h1>Tobey Maguire</h1>
            <p>
              Tobias Vincent Maguire was born on June 27, 1975, in Santa Monica,
              California, to Wendy Brown and Vincent Maguire. His parents (who
              are both of Scottish ancestry) married shortly after his birth but
              separated when he was two years old, and Maguire spent much of his
              childhood living with various family members. During his
              childhood, Maguire entertained the idea of becoming a chef and
              wanted to enroll in a home economics class as a sixth grader. His
              mother offered him $100 to take a drama class instead, and he
              agreed.The transient nature of his school years began to take a
              toll on Maguire emotionally, and after another relocation for his
              freshman year, he dropped out of high school and did not return.
              Instead, he pursued an acting career.By 2000, he had obtained his
              General Educational Development credential, noting that during his
              school days, "I was not doing school; I was showing up, but... not
              really giving myself."
